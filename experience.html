		<p class="leftalign">In high school, I created an <em>HTML website</em> for the dance studio I attended, working closely with the owner to bring her vision to life while ensuring every <em>visual</em> and <em>technical</em> detail was perfect. I also created a <em>website, brochures, forms</em> and other documents for a pain management medical practice. I spent hours happily absorbed in this <em>detail-oriented</em> work. As I got older, my passion for sustainability drew me to environmental engineering. </p>
		<p class="leftalign">Now my love of web design is calling me back, and I am taking online courses in web development. Check out my education page <a href="education.html">here</a> to follow my progress!</p>

		<p>With over six years of engineering experience, I know about design.</p>
		<p>Ensuring that a wastewater treatment facility is designed, built, and operated correctly may not sound much like web design, but this detail oriented work has made me an expert at:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>analyzing layouts</li>
			<li>spotting small errors, and </li>
			<li>researching new innovations for continual process improvement.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I enjoy finding out how things are built, what makes them work, and how to improve efficacy.</p>
